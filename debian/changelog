      spurious diffs when comparing to VPP dataplane addresses.

vppcfg (0.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  Feature release:
    * Allow the ability to set --novpp flag on planners. See user-guide for
      details.
    * Add device-type to the schema, which allows the configuratoin to specify
      'dpdk' type interfaces. This paves the way for RDMA and AVF interfaces
      in a later release.
    * Some small bugfixes and refactors
    * Lint: address a few pylint errors

    * Bugfix: correctly prune vxlan tunnels which have an address set
    * Lint: address a few pylint errors
